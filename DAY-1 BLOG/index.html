    <h1>DAY 1 TASK</h1>
    <h2>1) Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2</h2>
    <h4>Introduction on HTTP</h4>
    <p>HTTP is a request-response protocol. This means that the browser sends a request to the server, and the server sends a response back</p>
    <p>HTTP is a client-server protocol, which means that it involves communication between a client such as a web browser or mobile app</p>
    <h4>HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2</h4>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>HTTP/1.1</th>
            <th>HTTP/2</th>
        <tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Threaded</td>
            <td>Single-threaded</td>
            <td>Multi-threaded</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Protocol</td>
            <td>Text-based</td>
            <td>Binary</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Performance</td>
            <td>slow</td>
            <td>faster</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>HTTP/1.1 is the original version of HTTP. It's a single-threaded protocol, which means that it can only send one request at a time. This can lead to performance problems, especially on slow connections</p>
    <p>HTTP/2 is a newer version of HTTP that addresses the performance problems of HTTP/1.1. It's a multiplexed protocol, which means that it can send multiple requests and responses over a single connection. This significantly improves performance, especially on slow connections.</p>

    <h2>2) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascrip</h2>
    <p>Objects are the most important data-type in JS</p>
    <p>Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair</p>
    <p>Every objects have some properties, The properties are stored as keys</p>
    <p>the values can be any data type, including other objects</p>
    <p>The internal representation of an object in JavaScript is called its "object structure" or "object layout."</p>
    <p>It is designed to be fast and efficient for property lookups</p>
    <h2>3) Read about IP address, port, HTTP methods, MAC address</h2>
    <h4>IP Address: </h4>
    <p>Internet Protocol Address is a unique numerical (<b>Logical Address</b>) label assigned to each device connected to a computer network.</p>
    <p>It act as an identifier for both the source and destination of communicating.</p>
    <p>IP addresses are divided into two: </p>
    <p>•	Public IP addresses: Used to identify on Internet.</p>
    <p>•	Private IP addresses: Used to identify on Local Network.</p>
    <h4>Port: </h4>
    <p>A port is a logical endpoint on a device.</p>
    <p>used to listen or to send data.</p>
    <p>Ports are identified by number.</p>
    <h4>HTTP Methods: </h4>
    <p>HTTP methods define the type of action to be performed based on a URL. The common HTTP methods are:</p>
    <p>
        <li>GET: Retrieves data from a server.</li>
        <li>POST: Sends data to a server to create a new resource.</li>
        <li>PUT: Updates an existing resource on a server.</li>
        <li>DELETE: Deletes a specified resource on a server.</li>
    <h4>MAC Address: </h4>  
    <p>Media Access Control Address is known as a hardware address or <b>physical address</b></p>
    <p>It is a unique number assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) of a network device</p>
    <p>is assigned by the manufacturer during the production of the NIC</p>
